# StaticLibraryDemo
## Overview
This project demonstrates how to make a static library with resources and tests
for an iOS project. Do note that this approach will be obsolete for iOS 8+
projects, as the SDK now supports the creation of dynamic frameworks.

Based on [Matt Galloway's excellent tutorial][tutorial] for iOS static libraries.
